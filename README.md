# Coding Challenges

In effort to keep working on my programming skills, this repository holds my progress through online challenges! 

## Challenge 1 - Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge
Welcome to the Lighthouse Labs 21-Day Coding Challenge! Over the next 21 days you’ll be travelling aboard the exploratory vessel ISS Lighthouse, on a mission to explore the galaxy.

Just as you depart the solar system, a gigantic space bug knocks you off course! As the ISS Lighthouse captain, you’ll need to solve daily coding challenges to repair the ship and continue on your mission.
